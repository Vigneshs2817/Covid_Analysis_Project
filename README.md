# Covid Analysis Project
Welcome to the Covid Analysis Project! This project is a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of Covid-19 data. Using SQL queries, I explored, cleaned, and derived key insights from the data, revealing patterns and trends associated with the pandemic. This analysis includes two key datasets and all SQL code used in the project.

## Project Overview
The Covid Analysis Project aims to uncover meaningful insights into the Covid-19 pandemic by analyzing data through SQL queries. This project provides a structured approach to understanding how different factors, such as location, vaccination rates, and case counts, have evolved.

## Key Objectives:
Analyze trends in COVID-19 cases across various regions
Investigate vaccination progress and its correlation with case reduction
Extract valuable insights that can support health policies and inform decision-making
